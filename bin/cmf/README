This directory contains "wrapper" scripts for the main bin
scripts.

NOTE: The top-level Ant build script will filter the *.in
files replacing the @PREFIX@ with the actual installation
path.

These wrappers serve several purposes:
1) They contain the CMF-specific Kerberos parameters.
2) They contain the CMF-specific Java deployment directory.
3) They facilitate automatic configuration file selection
through the use of symlinks, e.g. linking to the "user"
script with a link named "gui" will invoke the main bin
script with a configuration file argument of
"@PREFIX@/etc/idol/gui.properties" (where @PREFIX@ is the
installed directory).  Since CVS does not manage symlinks,
these links must be created using the make-links script.

NOTE: Although not mandatory, it is suggested that this
directory *NOT* be world-readable, as it contains
potentially sensitive site-specific configuration
information.
