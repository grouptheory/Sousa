This directory contains two startup scripts, one for
starting the SOUSA/IDOL service agents, the other for
starting the user agent.

NOTE: The top-level Ant build script will filter the *.in
files replacing the @PREFIX@ with the actual installation
path.

The scripts handle several essentials:
1) Setting up the library path, classpath and JNI path for
all required components.
2) Setting up the various system properties related to the
use of Kerberos/GSSAPI.
3) Setting up other system properties such as JDBC driver,
AWT configuration, and SOUSA/IDOL configuration file.
4) Invoking the JVM.

Each script has a --help option listing all supported
parameters.
