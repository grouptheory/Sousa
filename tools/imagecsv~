# Usage: imagecsv image_program FILES
#
# Where
#   image_program is a tool that prints, among other things, the 
# longitude and latitude of the upper left and lower right corners
# of the bounding box of an image file.
#
#   FILES are image files
#
#
# For each file named on the command line, imagecsv invokes the
# image_program, extracts the bounding box from its output, and prints
# the name of the file followed by the bounding box. The output for is
# comma separated and of the form
#
# file name, upper left lon, upper left lat, lower right lon, lower right lat
#
# imagecsv assumes that bounding_box.awk understands the output
# of image_program.
