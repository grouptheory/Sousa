initial pass of a VR viewer for Sousa's geospatial dataservers.

requires OpenSceneGraph to be installed.

essentially a  hacked version of osgviewer that doesn't load a 
model, instead creates/deletes/moves geometry as instructed by 
a Sousa federation. 

uses IdolConnection to connect to a Sousa federation, loads
DataLayers and manipulates them according to commands, sends
the eyepoint back to the Sousa federation.
