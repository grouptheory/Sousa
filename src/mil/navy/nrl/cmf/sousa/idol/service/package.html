IDOL Service Entities offer services to other Entities.  The services
typically offer information in response to queries.  In addition, the
services can perform actions for their clients using a form of RMI.

Each kind of Service Entity is initialized using a {@link
mil.navy.nrl.cmf.sousa.idol.service.ServerInitializer}, which
advertises the service in a service directory.
