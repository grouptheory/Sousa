IDOL, the Interactive Distributed Object Library, is a collection of Entity
classes implemented using the SOUSA framework.  

There are two kinds of Entities: user and service.  Service Entities do
work for user Entities.  User Entities represent a person or a process
that needs services.

Each kind of Entity is initialized using an {@link
mil.navy.nrl.cmf.sousa.idol.IdolInitializer}.  The IdolInitializer
uses a {@link java.util.Properties} object to automatically create and
initialize the values of the Entity's State, set up the communications
parameters, and create a console command interpreter.
