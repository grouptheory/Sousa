This directory contains the JAAS configuration files use
to manage the authentication of IDOL service and user agents
during startup.  Currently configured for Kerberos/GSSAPI,
they require several system properties to be set as they use
property expansion:

Both scripts need sun.security.krb5.principal set, i.e.
-Dsun.security.krb5.principal=user@REALM

For services, the property krb5.keytab is required, and for
users the property krb5.ccname is required.
